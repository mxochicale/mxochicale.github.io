Hi, I'm Miguel.
I'm a Senior Research Engineer at University College London, where I lead work on open-source technologies from robotics to AI tools, aimed at improving healthcare.
I specialise in medical imaging, MedTech, SurgTech, biomechanics, and clinical translation, with a strong focus on open, accessible innovation. 
My aim is to turn cutting-edge research into real-world solutions that make a lasting impact.
Some of the key areas I work on include:
Real-time AI for surgery,
Eye movement and neurological disorders,
AI-assisted echocardiography, 
Sensor fusion combining wearables and EEG devices with medical imaging,
Generative AI for fetal scans,
Human-robot and child-robot interaction in healthcare and low-resource settings

I'm committed to transforming healthcare through safe, scalable, and open AI solutions.
If you're interested in collaborating, whether in research, academic-industry partnerships, or developing AI-powered healthcare software, let's connect.
