Hi, I am Miguel. 
My research interests are in the creation of Real-time and automatic Signal and Image Processing techniques in the context of Human-Robot Interaction, Wearables in Medicine, Ultrasound-Guided Interventions, Medical Robotics, Biomechanics, and Research Software Engineering.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a Research Associate at King's College London within the <a class="white" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis">School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences</a> where in the <a class="white" href="http://vital.oucru.org/">Vietnam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory (VITAL)</a> project I am scientifically contributing with automatic biometric recognition from Cardiac ultrasound data using deep learning techniques, these in close collaboration with <a class="white" href="https://gomezalberto.github.io/">Dr Alberto Gomez</a>.
Before that, as a postdoctoral researcher, between April 2019 to August 2021, I pushed forward the state-of-the-art of ultrasound-guided procedures in the <a class="white" href="https://www.gift-surg.ac.uk/"> Guided Instrumentation for Fetal Therapy and Surgery (GIFT-Surg)</a> project where I made scientific contributions to new algorithms, software, hardware and medical device quality management systems, those in close collaboration with Prof. of Interventional Image Computing <a class="white" href="https://cai4cai.ml/">Tom Vercauteren</a> and <a class="white" href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=bLvnwOAAAAAJ/">Dr. Wenfeng Xia</a>.
In July 2019, I was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the <a class="white"  href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx">University of Birmingham</a> where I investigated <a class="white"  href="https://mxochicale-phd.github.io/site/"> Nonlinear Analysis to Quantify Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction</a> under the supervision of Prof. of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing <a class="white" href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/baber-chris.aspx">Chris Baber</a> and Prof. of Information Engineering <a class="white"  href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/russell-martin.aspx">Martin Russell</a>.

<p>
I have 20 years' experience in human-robot interaction, electronics, mechatronics, signal processing and AI in healthcare, along with 12 years' experience as a teaching associate in Mechatronic and Computer Engineering and 5 years' experience in public engagement activities.
I have passion for <a class="white"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a> meaning that I open-sourced  all my contributions to knowledge in my GitHub <a class="white"  href="https://github.com/mxochicale">@mxochicale</a>.
I also tweet and re-tweet about AI, Robotics, Chaos, AI and Healthcare <a class="white" href="https://twitter.com/_mxochicale">@_mxochicale</a>,
I write in my <a class="white" href="http://mxochicale.github.io/blog/ ">blog</a> from time to time, and in my free time am trying to improve <a class="white" href=/assets/images/avatar/mapx_april2016.jpg>my juggling skills</a> and enjoy time with my family and friends.
