Hi, I am Miguel. 
I am currently a Reserach Engineer at University College London, UK.
My research focuses on developing data-centric AI tools for Medical Imaging, MedTech, SurgTech, Biomechanics and clinical translation.
Particularly, I have passion for generative models for fetal imaging, sensor fusion data with wearables and medical imaging, real-time AI for echocardiography, image-guided procedures, AI-based surgical navigation, and child-robot interaction in low resource countries.
