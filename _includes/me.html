I am a Research Associate in the Department of Surgical and
Interventional Engineering at King's College London where
I am currently pushing forward the state-of-the-art of ultrasound-guided
procedures making scientific contributions to new algorithms,
software and hardware.
I have 20 years’ experience in human-robot interaction, electronics, mechatronics and signal processing,
along with 12 years’ experience as a teaching associate in Mechatronic and Computer Engineering.

<p>
I have passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a>
meaning that I, as much as I can, open sourced all my contributions in my GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/mxochicale">@mxochicale</a>.
I also tweet and re-tweet about Robotics, AI and Physics <a href="https://twitter.com/_mxochicale">@_mxochicale</a>.
Please, do get in touch. I am always looking for new collaborations and opportunities!
