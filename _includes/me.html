<p>
I am currently a Research Associate at King's College London (KCL) within
the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences (BMEIS) where
I am pushing forward the state-of-the-art of ultrasound-guided
procedures by making scientific contributions to new algorithms,
software and hardware.
I have 20 years’ experience in human-robot interaction, electronics, mechatronics and signal processing,
along with 12 years’ experience as a teaching associate in Mechatronic and Computer Engineering.

I have passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a>
meaning that I open sourced, as much as I can, all my contributions in my GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/mxochicale">@mxochicale</a>.
I also tweet and re-tweet about Robotics, AI and Physics <a href="https://twitter.com/_mxochicale">@_mxochicale</a>.
Please, do get in touch. I am always looking for new collaborations and opportunities!
