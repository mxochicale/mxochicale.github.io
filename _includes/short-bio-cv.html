<p>
I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at University College London at <a class="white"  href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/arc">the Advanced Research Computing Centre </a>, advancing real-time AI-enabled surgical tools by developing end-to-end frameworks, including training, inference, API design, and deployment to medical devices (see  <a class="white"  href="https://mxochicale.github.io/real-time-ai-for-surgery-with-NVIDIA-Holoscan-platform/#/section">slides</a>). 
Furthermore, I am driving improvements in the quality and reproducibility of UCL's open-source software projects, ensuring they meet the highest standards of excellence. (see <a class="white"  href="https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/PIXL">PIXL Image eXtraction Laboratory</a> and <a class="white"  href="https://github.com/SciKit-Surgery">Surgical Navigation tools</a>).
Similarly, I contributed to maintain AI-based <a class="white"  href="https://github.com/SciKit-Surgery">Surgical Navigation tools</a> in collaboration with <a class="white"  href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-rD4cJIAAAAJ">Stephen Thompson</a>, <a class="white"  href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=TMDOW59">Dr Thomas Dowrick</a> and <a class="white"  href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42">Prof Matt Clarkson</a> from <a class="white"  href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/interventional-surgical-sciences">WEISS</a>.

Previously, I was a Research Associate at King's College London within the <a class="white" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis">School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences</a> where in the <a class="white" href="http://vital.oucru.org/">Vietnam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory (VITAL) project</a>  between September 2021 to September 2022, I scientifically contributed to automatic biometric recognition from Cardiac ultrasound data using deep learning techniques, these in collaboration with <a class="white" href="https://gomezalberto.github.io/">Dr Alberto Gomez</a> and <a class="white" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/andrew-king">Dr Andrew King</a>.
Before that, as a Research Associate between April 2019 to August 2021, I pushed forward the state-of-the-art of ultrasound-guided procedures in the <a class="white" href="https://www.gift-surg.ac.uk/"> Guided Instrumentation for Fetal Therapy and Surgery (GIFT-Surg)</a> project where I scientifically contributed to the development of new algorithms, software, hardware and medical device quality management systems, those in close collaboration with Prof. of Interventional Image Computing <a class="white" href="https://cai4cai.ml/">Tom Vercauteren</a> and <a class="white" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bLvnwOAAAAAJ">Dr. Wenfeng Xia</a>.
In July 2019, I was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the <a class="white"  href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx">University of Birmingham</a> where I investigated <a class="white"  href="https://mxochicale-phd.github.io/site/"> Nonlinear Analysis to Quantify Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction</a> under the supervision of Prof. of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing <a class="white" href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/baber-chris.aspx">Chris Baber</a> and Prof. of Information Engineering <a class="white"  href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/russell-martin.aspx">Martin Russell</a>.

<p>
Generally speaking, I have 20 years' experience in human-robot interaction, electronics, Mechatronics, signal processing and AI in healthcare, along with 12 years' experience as a teaching associate in Mechatronics nd Computer Engineering and 5 years' experience in public engagement activities.
I have passion for <a class="white"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a> meaning that I open-sourced  all my contributions to knowledge in my GitHub <a class="white"  href="https://github.com/mxochicale">@mxochicale</a>.
I also tweet and re-tweet about AI, Robotics, Chaos, AI and Healthcare <a class="white" href="https://twitter.com/_mxochicale">@_mxochicale</a>,
I write in my <a class="white" href="http://mxochicale.github.io/blog/ ">blog</a> from time to time, and in my free time am trying to improve <a class="white" href=/assets/images/avatar/mapx_april2016.jpg>my juggling skills</a> and enjoy time with my family and friends.
