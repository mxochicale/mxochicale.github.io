<h2>Details</h2>
Many of what you see in my [website](https://github.com/mxochicale/mxochicale.github.io), 
since its initial commit in [8 Feb 2016](https://github.com/mxochicale/mxochicale.github.io/commit/db3031aa3978a6a03382587c20f875fb1d638fcb),
 is a collection of code from [a continuous searching of open-source acedemic sites](https://github.com/mxochicale/mxochicale.github.io/issues/1).
However, I would say that the current template is mainly a combination of the sites 
of [rodluger.github.io](https://github.com/rodluger/rodluger.github.io),
[oliviaguest.github.io](https://github.com/oliviaguest/oliviaguest.github.io)
and code snippets from [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/). 
Many thanks to Rodrigo, Olivia and the community in codepen for putting your code open to anyone :)
