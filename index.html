				I am a Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Electronic, Electrical
				and Systems Engineering at University of Birmingham UK.
				I am interested in the field of Human-Robot Interaction and Human Activity Recognition.
				For my Ph.D. I am specifically gaining deeper understanding
				of movement variability using Nonlinear Dynamics and
				Deep Learning Algorithms to create novel analysis and interpretation
				of signals collected through a network of	wearable inertial measurement units.

				<p>
				Prior to pursuit my scientific endevours in my Ph.D., I developed a simple
				Dance Demo Interation with a service Robot at
				<a href="http://ccc.inaoep.mx/grupos/robotica.php"> INAOE's robotics laboratory </a>
				and worked in various Universities in Puebla, Mexico.
				My background includes Electronics and Mechatronics
				as well as Digital Signal Processing.
