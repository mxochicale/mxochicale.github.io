				I am a Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Electronic, Electrical
				and Systems Engineering at University of Birmingham UK.
				I am interested in the field of Human-Robot Interaction and Human Activity Recognition.
				For my Ph.D. I am gaining deeper understanding of movement variability
				using Nonlinear Dynamics and Deep Learning Algorithms to create novel
				analysis and interpretation of time series.
				My background includes Electronics and Mechatronics as well as
				Digital Signal Processing.
