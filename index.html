				I am a Doctoral Researcher in the School of Electronic, Electrical and
				Computer Engineering at University of Birmingham UK. I am interested in
				the field of Human-Robot Interaction and Human Activity Recognition.
				For my Ph.D. I am specifically gaining deeper understanding
				of the variability of human movements using Nonlinear Dynamics and
				Machine Learning Algorithms to create novel analysis and interpretation
				of signals collected through a network of	wearable inertial measurement units.

				Prior to my scientific endevours in my Ph.D., I develop a simple
				Dance Demo Interation with a service Robot at INAOE and worked
				in various Universities	in Puebla Mexico.
				My background includes Electronic and Mechatronics
				as well as Digital Signal Processing.
