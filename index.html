<p>
I am generally interested in the field of Human Activity Recognition and Human-Robot
Interaction. As a doctoral researcher, I am specifically gaining a deeper understanding of
the variability of simple and complex human movements so as to create novel analysis
and interpretation of signals from inertial sensors.
