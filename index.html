		I am a Research Associate in the Department of Surgical and  
		Interventional Engineering at King's College London where I am contributing 
		to the creation of new hardware, software and algorithms 
		in order to push forward the state-of-the-art of Ultrasound Guided Interventions.

		In July 2019, I was awarded a PhD in Computer Engineering where 
		one of my achievements is the publication of the first Open Accessible and 
		100% reproducible PhD thesis since the establishment of the University of Birmingham 
		in 1900. 		
		In four-year PhD, I investigated nonlinear analysis of movement 
		variability in the context of human-robot interaction under 
		the supervision of 
		Prof. Chris Baber (Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing) and 
		Prof. Martin Russell (Information Engineering). 

		My background includes electronics and mechatronics, signal processing, 
		artificial intelligence and robotics.

		I have passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science"> Open Science </a>
		meaning that I release pretty much all my contributions in GitHub  
		<a href="https://github.com/mxochicale"> @mxochicale</a>.
		I also tweet and re-tweet about Robotics, AI and Physics <a href="https://twitter.com/_mxochicale"> @_mxochicale </a>
