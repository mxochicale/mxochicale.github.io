<p>
	I am interested in the field of Human Activity Recognition and Human-Robot Interaction.
	As a doctoral researcher I am specifically gaining deeper understanding of the variability
	of human movements using Non-linear Dynamics and Machine Learning Algorithms
	to create novel analysis and interpretation of signals collected through a network of inertial measurement units.<br>
