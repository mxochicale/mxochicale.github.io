				I am interested in the field of Human Activity Recognition and Human-Robot Interaction.
				As a doctoral researcher I am specifically gaining deeper understanding of the variability
				of human movements using Non-linear Dynamics and Machine Learning Algorithms
				to create novel analysis and interpretation of signals collected through a network of inertial measurement units.
