    Tlaxcala, México where he received his basic education.
    In 2004, he received a B.Sc. degree in Electronics at
    Puebla Institute of Technology <a href="http://www.puebla.tecnm.mx/portalitp/">(ITP)</a>, México.
    In 2006, he received his M.Sc. degree in Electronics at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics
    <a href="http://www.inaoep.mx/">(INAOE)</a>, México.
</p>

<p>
    Between 2006 to 2013, he was a teaching associate
    in the areas of Electronics, Mechatronic and Computer Engineering
    at three Universities in Puebla, México.
    In 2013, he was a research associate in Robotics for six months
    at <a href="http://ccc.inaoep.mx/grupos/robotica.php"> INAOE's robotics laboratory</a>
    where he developed a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw-lZam_qZI">Human-Robot Dance Interaction</a>.
    Such work along with other contributions of the
    <a href="    http://robotic.inaoep.mx/~markovito">Markovito</a>’s team
    was presented at the Mexican Tournament of Robotics 2013 wining
    the first place in the category at HOME
</p>

<p>
    Between January to July 2014, he prepared his application for a
    PhD scholarship. In October 2014, he then was awarded a four-year PhD scholarship
    by the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology <a href="http://www.conacyt.mx/">(CONACYT)</a>
    and the <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx">University of Birmingham</a>.
    During his four-year PhD, he investigated nonlinear analysis of movement
    variability in the context of human-robot interaction under
    the supervision of
    <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/baber-chris.aspx"> Prof. Chris Baber, chair of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, </a>
    and <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/russell-martin.aspx"> Prof. of Information Engineering Martin Russell</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In July 2019, he was awarded a PhD in Computer Engineering where
    one of his achievements is the publication of the first Open Accessible and
    100% reproducible <a href="https://mxochicale-phd.github.io/site/">PhD thesis</a>
    since the establishment of the <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx">University of Birmingham</a> in 1900.
</p>

<p>
	Currently, he is a Research Associate in
    <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis/our-departments/surgical-interventional-engineering">the Department of Surgical and
	Interventional Engineering</a>
    at King's College London where
	he is pushing forward the state-of-the-art of ultrasound-guided
	procedures by making scientific contributions to new algorithms,
	software and hardware.
